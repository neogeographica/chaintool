The other sections of the documentation are about using chaintool; this final section is about the chaintool code itself.

Note that chaintool is purpose-built as a command-line utility. The public interfaces of its modules are for the use of other modules within the package, and are largely not that useful for integration with external code.

The module interfaces are documented here as a matter of form, and as a reference for any work extending or modifying chaintool.

XXX Anything else to say about overall structure? How about the completion scripts and chaintool_completions_helper?
