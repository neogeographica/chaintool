.. warning::

   In its current (pre-1.0) state, chaintool is being developed and tested on Linux and macOS. The core functionality should work on Windows but is untested there. Windows-specific considerations have not been added to these docs. The "shortcuts" feature will need to be adapted to work natively with Windows. The "bash completions" feature will not ever work with Windows, at least not in the sense of running natively (as opposed to with WSL), and will need to be gracefully disabled there. Bottom line: don't use chaintool on Windows yet.
